# A fork of kjliew/qemu-3dfx
My builds on Windows 11 & Ubuntu 22.04:
+ minimal binaries
+ text guide on minimal environment preparation
+ a modified version of VMAddons.iso (from the original found here: https://archive.org/details/qemu-3dfx-vmaddons)
+ Win98 VM with 3DMark & AquaMark installed (worked on my machines)
